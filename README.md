# MaSResourcePack
A resource pack for the MineAndSeek project. Optional and has no additional dependencies.

**Current Version:** 1.20.2

**Optifine Needed:** No

## Contribution
We retexture armors AND trims to bring our total number of custom skins to 22 (16 trims + 6 armors). This allows us to avoid using OptiFine CIT at the moment so that we can keep the experience as vanilla as possible.

However, this comes with the limitation that at least one of the 6 armor skins **cannot** use the outermost layer for the head or else it will conflict with the trim-based skins. For this reason, the diamond skin (arbitrarily picked) should not have any pixels used from the outermost layer of the head.

If we need more than 22 skins in the future, we will likely just switch to using OptiFine CIT and use standardized, named armor (e.g. netherite armor for all Hunters, iron armor for all Survivors).
