# MaSResourcePack
A resource pack for the MineAndSeek project. Optional and can be used without OptiFine, though it's highly recommended to have both. Without the resource pack all the abilities look like carrot-on-a-sticks and without OptiFine all of the kits just have the same armor (iron for Survivors, netherite for Hunters).

**Current Version:** 1.20.2

## Contribution
Pretty straightforward - save the skin you want and upload it to the corresponding folder under `optifine/cit`. Duplicate one of the `*.properties` files in the same folder and rename it to have the same name as your skin. Last, edit the new properties file and replace all instances of the old name (e.g. `clyde`) with the new name.

**Note:** Due to limitations with the way armor works, the skins must be symmetrical (i.e. left side must match the right side).
